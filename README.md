# glowing_social_media_icons
 here you will see bright social media icons. Hope you like!
 
 Social media icons are presented as buttons, each with an icon corresponding to a specific social network, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn. When the mouse hovers over the button, a glow effect is added to the social network icon, which makes the icon more attractive and helps draw the user's attention. 
 
 The design is highly customizable, allowing developers to adapt the colors and brightness effects of the icons according to the needs of their own projects.
 
 The project also includes a real-time demonstration of the social media icons with glow effects, which can be accessed directly in the web browser.
